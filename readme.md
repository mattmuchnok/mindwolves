# MindWolves App

## Description:
Create an app for an existing business which currently serves clients in their pursuit of personal development. Functionality will help to centralize current tasks that the coach and/or clients enact on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. The MVP will not serve all of these tasks, but that will be the goal in the future.
